Inverted index pattern is used to generate an index from a data set to allow for faster searches or data enrichment capabilities.It is often convenient to index large data sets on keywords, so that searches can trace terms back to records that contain specific values. While building an inverted index does require extra processing up front, taking the time to do so can greatly reduce the amount of time it takes to find something. Search engines build indexes to improve search performance. Imagine entering a keyword and letting the engine crawl the Internet and build a list of pages to return to you. Such a query would take an extremely long amount of time to complete. By building an inverted index, the search engine knows all the web pages related to a keyword ahead of time and these results are simply displayed to the user. These indexes are often ingested into a database for fast query responses.  

Write  a map-reduce for inverted index which generate the list of words in the files and the set of files that contains each terms and the word frequency in each of the files.
